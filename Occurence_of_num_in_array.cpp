/*
!!!!!!!!!!!!!this example is an application of binary search!!!!!!
Description - Given a sorted array arr[ ] and a number x, We have to count the occurrences of x in arr[ ].
Input : [1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3] , x = 2
Output : 4
*/
/*
Solution: Binary Search We can solve this problem using binary search by reducing the effective search space in each step. We will be using these steps -
1.Use Binary search to get the index of the first occurrence of x in arr[ ]. Let the index of the first occurrence be i.
2.Use Binary search to get the index of the last occurrence of x in arr[ ]. Let the index of the last occurrence be j.
3.Return the count as difference between first and last indices (j â€“ i + 1);
